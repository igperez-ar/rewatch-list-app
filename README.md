# Rewatch List App

A modern, cross-platform React Native application for managing and tracking movies you want to rewatch. Built with a focus on maintainability, scalability, and developer experience, this project leverages best practices such as Atomic Design for UI, Hexagonal Architecture for business logic, and a modular, type-safe codebase.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Movie Watchlist**: Add, update, and remove movies from your personal rewatch list.
- **Movie Details**: View and edit details, including ratings and genres.
- **Genre Management**: Browse and select genres for your movies.
- **Persistent Storage**: Data is managed via Supabase for real-time, cloud-based persistence.
- **Responsive UI**: Consistent experience across Android and iOS, with custom fonts and theming.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Best Practices

### Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)
- **Domain Logic**: All business rules are isolated in the `domain` layer, making them framework-agnostic and easily testable.
- **Adapters**: Infrastructure (e.g., Supabase, mocks) is injected via adapters, allowing for easy swapping and mocking in tests.
- **Use Cases**: Application-specific workflows are encapsulated in use-case classes, promoting single responsibility and clarity.

### Atomic Design for UI
- **Atoms**: Smallest UI components (e.g., `Text`, `Box`, `Icon`).
- **Molecules**: Combinations of atoms (e.g., `Dropdown`, `Header`, `Input`).
- **Templates**: Layout scaffolds (e.g., `GradientContainer`, `MainContainer`).
- **Screens**: Full pages composed of templates, molecules, and atoms.

### Type Safety & Testing
- **TypeScript**: End-to-end type safety, including custom types for Supabase and global app types.
- **Unit & Integration Tests**: Located alongside use-cases and screens, with fixtures and mocks for reliable, isolated testing.

### State Management & Theming
- **Redux Toolkit**: Modular state slices for configuration and app state.
- **Theming**: Centralized theme management for consistent look and feel.
